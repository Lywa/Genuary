## Genuary

Using _OpenFrameworks_ for a month.

Challenges from:

https://genuary2021.github.io

GENUARY is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things.

It happens during the month of January 2021.

For every 24 hour day within this 744 hour timespan, we have prepared a prompt with instructions for you to execute.

You don’t have to follow the prompt exactly. Or even at all. But, y’know, we put effort into this.

You can use any language, framework or medium. Please respect the Geneva Conventions.


I'll upload my daily challenges here:


## 1st of January

// TRIPLE NESTED LOOP

The first two nested loops create a grid & the third draws a series of squares that start from the same point (x,y) with incremental size within every point in the grid. Additionally, every square alternates colors to create an illusion of depth.

![day 1](Jan-1/Jan-1_2.png)
_Baseline colors: B/W_

![day 1](Jan-1/Jan-1_1.png)
_Baseline colors: B/W + Black background_

![day 1](Jan-1/Jan-1_3.png)
_Baseline colors: B/W + Gray background_

![day 1](Jan-1/Jan-1_4.png)
_Custom colors: Purple & White + Salmon background_

## 3rd of January

// Make something human

What's more human than emotions? Not too human pixelized smiley faces.

![day 3](Jan-3/Jan-3_1.png)
_Pixelized icons using the value of the pixel in greyscale to created different radius' circles._


## 4rd of January

// Small areas of symmetry

For me Anni Albers' work is always an inspiration. First thing that came to mind when reading today's prompt it was one of Anni's Tapestries. So here it goes!

_Anni Albers Tapestry used as a baseline for today's geometry challenge._

## 5th of January

// Do some code golf! How little code can you write to make something interesting? Share the sketch and its code together if you can.

This is a great challenge as writing short code is not exactly my forte. My goal was to created some geometric appeal with the least lines of code possible. 

![day 5](Jan-5/Jan-5_1.png)
_First iteration drawing circles that increase in size by a counter and change position in relation to a sin and cos function_

![day 5](Jan-5/Jan-5_2.png)
_Second iteration drawing circles that increase in size by a counter and change position in relation to a sin and cos function_

## 6th of January

// Triangle subdivision.

I wanted to work with replicating geometries, so I used the prompt to create a base module.

![day 6](Jan-6/Jan-6_1.png)
_Base module, two overlapping equilateral triangles mirrored from the center of the screen._

![day 6](Jan-6/Jan-6_2.png)

_Using translation to rotate the overlapping triangles from the center of the screen. Every frame there is a rotation an a new module drawn._

![day 6](Jan-6/Jan-6_3.png)

_Using a different color for each overlapping module._

![day 6](Jan-6/Jan-6_4.png)
_Increasing the triangle size at every frame._

## 7th of January

// Generate some rules, then follow them by hand on paper.

![day 7](Jan-7/Jan-7_1.jpg)

_Set of instructions written to be followed using a grid paper and a pen._

![day 7](Jan-7/Jan-7_2.jpg)

_Instructions followed by another person._


## 8th of January

// Curves only

The goal for me was to create a brush that would create curves semicircles in different conditions using the mouse position to draw the Polylines.


![day8](Jan-8/Jan-8_1.png)

_First brush using the mouse position as center for the semicircle. In this case the drawing was caotic and disorganized._

_First brush using the mouse position as center for the semicircle. In this case the drawing was organized and harmonic._

_Second brush using 0,0 as the center of the semicircle. Mouse Position changes the radius of the circle and the position._

## 9th of January

// Interference patterns.

I wanted to keep it simple to ensure the pattern was truly an interference. In a future iteration I'd like to explore kinetic interferences.

![day9](Jan-9/Jan-9_1.png)

_2 sets of concentric circles drawn from the 2 thirds of the screen to create an interference._

_2 sets of concentric circles drawn from the 2 thirds of the screen to create an interference. Adding depth using colors._

## 10th of January

// TREE

What best than a tree covered in snow! I wanted redraw an image pixel by pixel using different shapes.


![day10](Jan-10/Jan-10_1.png)

_Pixelized tree drawn using squares._

## 11th of January

// Use something other than a computer as an autonomous process (or use a non-computer random source).

TBD

## 12th of January

//Use an API (e.g. the weather). Here’s a huge list of free public APIs.

I skipped this one. I've struggled to add an API to OpenFrameworks. I unsuccesfully tried using ofxJSON.


## 13th of January

//Do not repeat.

I created a line that rotates from the center in a very soothing manner.

## 14th of January

// SUBDIVISION

![day14](Jan-14/Jan-14_1.png)
_I drew consecutive lines that divided the remaining area on the right or below into halves._
